# HW 1: Waypoint Following PID

In this HW, you need to implement PID controller to follow waypoints along a path.

## Code structure

```
.
+-- gem_waypoint_pid
|  +-- waypoints
|  |  +-- wps.csv              # waypoints list
|  |  +-- records_wps          # visualization of waypoints
|  +-- scripts
|  |  +-- gen_waypoint.py      # for generating waypints
|  |  +-- pid.py               # for implementing PID controller
|  |  +-- follow_waypoints.py  # main script to interact with the simulator
```
